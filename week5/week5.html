    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.  Exceptions are errors that produce a return
        value.  Exceptions also produce a stack trace which is a sequence of functions or methods that point to
        where the error occurred.  Warnings can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the 
        code to crash.<br><br>

        Strict Mode: This considers previous poor coding practices as actual errors.  To use strict mode, just add
        'use strict'; to the .js file.  Linting tools can be even stricter and would be good to enforce
        a particular style guide when working as teams.<br><br>

        You can use 'alert' in a function to display a variable.  This is one way to make sure you are passing or recieving
        the correct variable in the functions.  Remember to remove the alert in the final code.<br><br>
        
        You can also use the console to display variable values.  Just use console.log.  This can be viewed in the browser
        console.  To quicly view in chrome press f12.<br><br>

        You can create custom exceptions using the throw statement.  We should constantly use exception handling and testing
        practices when creating code. There are testing frameworks that can assist in finding problems and fixing them.
