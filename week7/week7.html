    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>I can see the functionality of memoization (.cache) property.  This could be great if working with a
    program where you call a function multiple times and need to debug the program.  You would be able to find
    the issue in the program.
    </p>
    <p>Async functions allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.  This is done by utilizing
        the 'await' operator before the function.  Using this and the promise feature allows us to write code without
        having to nest all the different functions to work together. 
    </p>
    <p> It seems that best practice would be to stay as close to functional programming as possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <p>I am not sure where or how you would use the apply() method.  It calls an array so in the example
        they have a square function that takes a value and multiplies it by itself.  If I had a similar function
        that was for a rectangle so I needed two values, can I use the apply like this? rectangle.apply(null, [4,6])?
    </p>
