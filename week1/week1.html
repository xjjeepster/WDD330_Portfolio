    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>The Master Mobile UX videos were very interesting and informative.  I was interested in how many people
        still don't recognize the "hamburger menu" as a clickable item.  I always thought this was intuitive and 
        made the page very clean; however, I ame reconsidering my opinion on it.  If I design a page where only
        a limited number of people understand how to move around in it, people will not utilize the page I made.
    </p>
    <p>It was also interesting to listen to how mobile devices have changed over the years and the design process
        in creating for mobile devices.  I for one was very frustrated in apples latest ios release for the iPhone.
        I do not like how it defaults to the search bar at the bottom of the page in Safari.  I can see why they did
        this so more users can reach it easier.  This is especially good for iPad or iPhone plus users who have a large
        screen.  I personally am not a fan of it and moved it back to the top. 
    </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <p>I'm not sure if I was just looking in the wrong place, but in the book "Doing Stuff with Web Things" I was unabe
        to find anything on "Localstorage" as it indicated I would be reading about.  Was I reading the wrong PDF book?
