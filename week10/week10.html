    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>Client-side form validation:<br>
        Client-side validation is making sure whatever you send to the server is in correct format and has
        no errors.  This is to prevent future issues and further troubleshooting stress. <br><br>

        Form validation:<br>
        Form validation is making sure required fields have to have input, and that the input into fields fits 
        the format requirements of that field.<br><br>

        Html 5 has built in form controls that help validate user input.<br>
        There are many ways to validate form entries. There are specific input variables that will require specific items.  You can constrain
        lengths or values inputed. You can require min or max numeric value.  There is a lot you can do with built in validation.<br><br>
        
        If you there isn't built in validation you can always work with javascript to create a validation.

        Using the Fetch API:<br>
        The fetch api provides a javascript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline.  It allows a logical way to 
        fetch resources across the network.  You can send a request with credentials from the browsers.  You can upload JSON or Files using fetch
