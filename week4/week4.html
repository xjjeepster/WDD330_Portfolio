    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>There was quite a bit of reading this week and a lot of it carries over to one of the other classes I have.
        I am also taking WDD 331 Advanced CSS.  We were talking about a lot of the same stuff this week and I kept 
        getting confused in which class I read a particular item.  We are working on bootstrap as a library and this 
        fit right in with chapter 15 modern JavaScript Development.  I have enjoyed playing around with the Quiz Ninja's 
        at the end of the chapters to see how each lesson is applied in a practical aspect.  The jump in chapters this week
        caused me to have to review at least the Quiz Ninja codes in the inbetween chapters so that my code could stay
        uptodate and work with the next chapter.  This was not as effective in Chapter 15 as we started working with 
        outside utilities and I believe my file structure that I'm utilizing for this class didn't work great with the 
        file structure for the game. I still enjoyed the reading and the practical lessons. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> See Console and week4.js for code from reading work.  I did several examples and worked the 
            Quiz Ninja code from each chapter. 
        </li>
