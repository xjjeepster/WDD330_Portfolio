    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>Most of this weeks reading were a good review as I haven't worked with Javascript for several semesters.
        Here are things I either forgot or haven't heard before:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the ++ or -- to increase values can be placed directly before or after the variable.  Both will increase the value by one,
            but wether you put it before or after will depend what the return shows.  If you put the operator before it will return the variable 
            with the new value, if you put the operator after the variable, it will return the variable prior to the new value.
        </li>
        <li>You can leave a blank spot in a array by filling it with 'undefined'.</li>
        <li>"Function Hoisting" means that functions can be declared prior to them being defined. This means that I can put all the function
            definitions in one place (possibly the end of the program) so they are easy to see and go through.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <p>
        I don't have any questions this week; however, it was a great review.
