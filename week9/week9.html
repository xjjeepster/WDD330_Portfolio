        Global variables are created using const, let, or var.  Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.  Global 
        Variables are part of the window object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dialogs: alert(), confirm(), prompt() are not part of the ECMAScript standard although all major browsers support them as methods
        of the window object.  window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in the dialog box.  
        window.confirm() dispays a confirmation dialog with an argument to press OK or Cancel.  wondow.prompt() will display a message with
        an input field to unter text.
